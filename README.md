This was the repository that hosted the previous revision of my site. I have now updated to the Hugo "Academic" theme, 
which gives me much better functionality and customizability compared to this theme. 

This project was originally hosted off of a static S3 bucket on AWS servers, but my current project is now hosted by [netlify][netlify.app]. This allows me to use Netlify CMS
